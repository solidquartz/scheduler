# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a React app that allows a student to book an interview slot on a given day. It is my third project at Lighthouse Labs, and my first React project. The server, API, and CSS were pre-made. Apart from React, I also used JSX and Axios, and created custom Hooks.

During this project, I also learned to write, implement, and debug tests with Jest and E2E testing with Cypress.

Using this app, a student can easily select a day and a time slot, with the "spots remaining" number updating dynamically. Students can provide their name and select an instructor, and then save, edit, and delete their appointments. Error handling is also implemented for user and server errors.
